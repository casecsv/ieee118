Power flow data for IEEE 118 bus test case.
This data was converted from IEEE Common Data Format
(ieee118cdf.txt) on 15-Oct-2014 by cdf2matp, rev. 2393
See end of file for warnings generated during conversion.

Converted from IEEE CDF file from:
    https://labs.ece.uw.edu/pstca/
With baseKV data take from the PSAP format file from the same site,
added manually on 10-Mar-2006.
Branches 86--87, 68--116 changed from transmission lines (tap ratio = 0)
to transformers (tap ratio = 1) for consistency with bus base voltages
on 2019-02-15.
